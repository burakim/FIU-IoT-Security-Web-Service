# FIU-IoT-Security-Web-Service
FIU IoT Security Class (EEL4717) Second Homework Smart Thermostat Webservice

Spring Boot and MongoDB technologies were used in this webservice. 

It gets sensor values from student's first homework (Smart thermostat sensor application), then it saves into database. 

Furthermore, it has a API call that retrieves user's latest sensor value to feed their android application.

To debug webservice on server
```sh
./gradlew clean bootRun
```
